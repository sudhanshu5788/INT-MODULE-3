# INTERMEDIATE PROJECT MODULE-3

This Solidity program is an example of creating your own token using local hardhat network and also interaction with that using remix IDE.

## Description

This program is a simple contract written in Solidity, and in this program we have first hosted our contract on local hardhat network and 
then interacted with that using Remix IDE.

## Getting Started

### Executing program

To run this program, first you have to open command prompt and then go to the root file of your project then pass the command npx hardhat node
. This command will start your server and now you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at 
https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., HelloWorld.sol).Paste the contract code into the file:

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. 
Now you can perform different operations and according to our given assesment we have to do minting only by our owner so it will only 
mint when the owner that we have provided will match with our minting address.
